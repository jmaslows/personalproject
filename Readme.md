##Personal Project
=========

##Introduction:

My capstone project was to work with my fellow team members to build and deploy a web portal that allowed our client to fulfill his business needs.  Our client was an organization named Frank's Angels.  It's goal was to create an online community where volunteers and community service organizers could gather and collaborate on projects and events in their neighborhoods.  My main task in the group was doing a lot of the back end coding to make sure a lot of features worked and were using the correct data from our database.  For my personal project I wanted to demonstrate that I also had knowledge of the front end design components of building a website or web application.  I'm hoping that like my initial knowledge of coding in php, which was none, I can continue to have the site grow and develop to always show the growth I achieve.
